      <p>My mom and dad took me to the family church when I was young to be baptised / dedicated. That was my first step to following the faith of chritianity. In the first photo on the welcome screen you can see that it shows my mom and dad holding me with in the church area.

      <p>The photo above was the photo taken when i got my room redone. My parents for the first time decided to decorate my room with me as a baby. We had the wallpaper be the lion king which was my favourite movie at that time and even to this day one of my favourite movies of all time for me. It's a Car memory because I remeber that it was the day after my birthday which was somewhat close to the date of my baptism. Most baby baptism or to phrase it better dedication is the right word, is a few days or weeks after their birth. Although I use the word baptising, its not a baptism actually i used that word as a scape goat for those that might not understand.</p>

      <p>For those of you who want to know what the difference is please read this: ("The key difference between baby dedication and infant baptism lies in their traditions and meanings. Baby dedication, common in Evangelical and non-denominational churches, is a ceremony where parents publicly commit to raising their child according to Christian values, with the support of the church community. It involves no water and has no connection to salvation, focusing instead on the child's future faith journey. In contrast, infant baptism, practiced in Catholic, Orthodox, and some Protestant traditions, is a sacrament that uses water to symbolize spiritual cleansing and marks the child's initiation into the faith community. Some traditions view baptism as necessary for salvation or as the beginning of a life of grace. While baby dedication emphasizes parental responsibility, baptism highlights the childâ€™s inclusion in the church and connection to God's grace.") .</p>
